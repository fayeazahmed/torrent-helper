# torrent-helper

Trying to play around with dot NET. This is a winform web scraping windows application. Enter name, and it will search for it in the piratebay, and show the list of only the important info like name of torrents, number of seed, leech and most importantly the magnet link. So just search, click magnet and default torrent client or appropriate pop up will show up.
